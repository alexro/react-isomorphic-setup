Just the minimal setup to run isomorphic ReactJS app:

---------------

after downloading cd into 01-minimal and run

npm install

then start the server and open up nodejs

npm start

running gulp with no args in a separate terminal will watch for changes and recompile the build.js
you still need to restart nodejs to pick up the changes server-side and refresh the browser
